by Amjad Abdullah, Cindy Hung Ling, Paolo Lubuguen, Raph Eric Caymo, Yohannes Daniel

# Objective:

The objective of this analysis is to explore the trends for different countries over the years 2000 to 2020. In regards to access to electricity, distribution of electricity sources (fossil fuels and renewables), and CO2 emision.

# Technical Objective:
To create a dashboard that links the map to chart. The map will control the data from the chart. 

# Where did we get our dataset?
The data was collected from Kaggle (Global Data on Sustainable Energy (2000-2020)
The table had 21 columns and 3650 rows and analyzed approximately 200 countries.


# Solution workflow:
CSV from Kaggle -> Data set clean up -> SQLite Setup -> Flask App Setup -> API -> Dashboard/HTML Connection

# Insights on this project:
More and more country are on to renewable energy. South American countries are mostly being run by renewable energy. North American countries, on the other hand, is hard on fossil fuel except Canada. Asia is still dependent on fossil fuel but we see a trend that renewable energy is growing slowly.
